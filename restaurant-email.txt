Subject: Quick setup — accept printed coupons with one scan

Hi [Restaurant Contact Name],

We will supply the printed coupons QR. To accept them with a single scan, please do this one-time setup:

What we'll send you securely:
  • Your STORE_ID (example: MCD-001)
  • API_KEY (secret string)

Steps (very small):
1) Save the attached file redeem.html to the register computer (e.g., C:\temp\redeem.html).
2) Open the file in the register browser (Chrome/Edge).
3) Edit redeem.html once to replace:
     const API_KEY = '<API_KEY_HERE>';
     const STORE_ID = '<STORE_ID_HERE>';
   (We will send values securely; this is a one-line edit.)
4) Ensure barcode scanner is configured to send an Enter after scan (default on most scanners).
5) Train cashiers: focus the "Scan here" field, scan the coupon on the customer's phone. If the page shows "Accepted" apply discount; if "Declined" do not apply.

We can do this update for you remotely if you prefer.

Thanks,
[Your name / publisher]
